<Highlights
  :features="[
    'Full keyboard navigation',
    'Can be controlled or uncontrolled',

    'Localization support',

## Preface

The component depends on the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package, which solves a lot of the problems that come with working with dates and times in JavaScript.

We highly recommend reading through the documentation for the package to get a solid feel for how it works, and you'll need to install it in your project to use the date-related components.

## Installation

Install the date package.

```bash
npm install -D @internationalized/date
```

Install the component from your command line.

```bash
npm install radix-vue
```

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```vue
<script setup>
import {
  DateFieldInput,
  DateFieldRoot,
} from 'radix-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <DateFieldRoot>
    <DateFieldInput />
  </DateFieldRoot>
</template>
```
